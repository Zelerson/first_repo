[Chorus]
We listen to the radio - dead radio
We listen to the radio - dead radio

[Bridge]
It's right here, right now that we best serve the beast of transmission
And the cool passing wave of ignorance
They say the heart is a lonely hunter
And the hardbox comes with a crime inside
OH YEAH!

"Today on this program you will hear..."
"The sound of our souls..."
"We know that music is music..."
"But when we're together, we got power!"

[Chorus]
We listen to the radio - dead radio
We listen to the radio - dead radio
