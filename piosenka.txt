[Chorus]
We listen to the radio - dead radio
We listen to the radio - dead radio

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you one thing man:
Nothing ever happens until you medicate
The Witch Queen of Mongo
And hail the passing of King George!
Everybody is eating on behalf of the Gods
With their plastic necks and their silver teeth

[Chorus]
We listen to the radio - dead radio
We listen to the radio - dead radio

[Bridge]
It's right here, right now that we best serve the beast of transmission
And the cool passing wave of ignorance
They say the heart is a lonely hunter
And the hardbox comes with a crime inside
OH YEAH!

"Today on this program you will hear..."
"The sound of our souls..."
"We know that music is music..."
"But when we're together, we got power!"

[Chorus]
We listen to the radio - dead radio
We listen to the radio - dead radio
