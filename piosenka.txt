[Intro]
"Radio has changed our lives and, possibly, saved our lives --"
"Radio has changed our lives and, possibly, saved our lives --"
"Radio has changed our lives and, possibly, saved our lives --"

Oh Yeah!

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you about Dead City Radio man
And the New Gods of Supertown
A world of magic lanterns and chemical blues
A world where X stands for the unknown and Y is the zero

Sluggish drones assault my radio
20 mortal lashes of grotesque audio
Glittering fountains, misspent youth
I'm a rhinestone tiger in a leisure suit

Turn it up! Turn it up! Turn it up! Oh Yeah!

[Chorus]
We listen to the radio - dead radio
We listen to the radio - dead radio

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you one thing man:
Nothing ever happens until you medicate
The Witch Queen of Mongo
And hail the passing of King George!
Everybody is eating on behalf of the Gods
With their plastic necks and their silver teeth

[Chorus]
We listen to the radio - dead radio
We listen to the radio - dead radio

[Bridge]
It's right here, right now that we best serve the beast of transmission
And the cool passing wave of ignorance
They say the heart is a lonely hunter
And the hardbox comes with a crime inside
OH YEAH!

"Today on this program you will hear..."
"The sound of our souls..."
"We know that music is music..."
"But when we're together, we got power!"

[Chorus]
We listen to the radio - dead radio
We listen to the radio - dead radio
