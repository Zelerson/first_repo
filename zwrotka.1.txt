I want to tell you about Dead City Radio man
And the New Gods of Supertown
A world of magic lanterns and chemical blues
A world where X stands for the unknown and Y is the zero

Sluggish drones assault my radio
20 mortal lashes of grotesque audio
Glittering fountains, misspent youth
I'm a rhinestone tiger in a leisure suit

Turn it up! Turn it up! Turn it up! Oh Yeah!
